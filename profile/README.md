# Welcome To The Team!

<p>
We are team 11781 MVS Rambotics, the official team of The Miami Valley School in Dayton, Ohio. As of this season, we have reached the seven-year mark as a team, but we still have tons to learn and we are excited about doing just that! Our team has 18 members, which is really a testament to the engaging and inclusive environment we aim to create here given our school's sub-two-hundred student population. We pride ourselves on making space for anyone to put in the time even if they don't see themselves as engineers. Our team aims to foster creativity, innovation, and cooperation amongst our entire community inside and outside the workspace.

# Team Contacts

<p>
Our team is always excited by opportunities to meet others and share our knowledge. We especially want to extend our reach to those outside our immediate community. In the spirit of FTC, we treasure any opportunities to reach out. To that end, there are many ways to contact us. Whether you hope to talk robot or software design, practice games and team mentorship, or just support our cause, you can find us at any of the places below.

#### Official Email

<p>
Finally, a school-sponsored email! If you find our work interesting, we are always happy to share it. If you're interested in getting technical, or if you're a fellow FTC team looking to get some practice in before a competition, you can always contact us directly at mvsrambotics@mvschool.com. This will put you directly in contact with our coaches, so you can expect a timely response on any regular school day.
