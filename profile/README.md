We are team 11781, or as we call ourselves, MVS Rambotics, a title inspired by our mascot, Marti the ram, and this is our seventh year competing within the ranks of FTC. Our team is comprised of 18 students and 2 faculty coaches from The Miami Valley School, a small, pre-k to 12 independent school in Dayton, Ohio. With our entire high schoolâ€™s population sitting at 162 students, the level of interest our club attracts is a testament to our collaborative and engaging atmosphere. In terms of team culture, we aim to foster creativity, innovation, and cooperation both within our team workspace and amongst our mentors and mentees.
