# Welcome To The Team!

<p>
We are team 11781, better known as MVS Rambotic, and this will be our 7th year competing in FTC.  We are a team from a small, independent, college prep school in Dayton, Ohio, called The Miami Valley School. Our team is comprised of 18 students and 2 teachers/coaches. Considering how small our schoolâ€™s population is, the level of interest that our team attracts is truly a testament to our engaging environment. Our team name was inspired by our school mascot Marti the Ram. Our team aims to foster creativity, innovation, and cooperation amongst our team members inside and outside the workspace.

# Team Outreach

<p>
Our team is always excited by opprotunities to meet others and share our knowledge. We especically want to extend our reach to those outside our immediate community. In the spirit of FTC, we treasure any opprotunities to reach out. To that end, there are many ways to contact us. Wether you hope to talk robot or software design, practice games and team mentorship, or just to support our cause, you can find us at any of the places below.
